          Hey , I am
          <span className="text-2xl font-semibold"> Denis Mutinda</span>
          &nbsp;â€”&nbsp;a passionate front-end developer with a knack for
          crafting seamless user interfaces. With three years of experience in
          the field, I&apos;ve worked my way up from junior roles to becoming a
          lead developer, honing my skills along the way at Prism.fm and through
          independent projects.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-5 ">
          I love collaborating on exciting projects, building beautiful,
          functional apps, and constantly finding ways to improve both the user
          experience and developer workflow. Whether it&apos;s bringing ideas to
          life with clean, intuitive code or optimizing processes to make life
          easier for everyone involved, I&apos;m all in.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-5 ">
          Currently, I&apos;m developing engaging web experiences at
          Taifa-Casino, a rising startup in Kenya&apos;s online betting scene.
          When I&apos;m not doing that, you can find me working on my own
          creative projects under DenisWritesCode and Caesius Agency.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-5 ">
          Take a look at my portfolio to see some of my work. If you&apos;d like
          to connect or have an interesting project in mind, don&apos;t hesitate
          to reach out.
