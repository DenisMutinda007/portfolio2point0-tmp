// Hi, I'm Denis Mutinda‚Äîa passionate front-end developer with a knack for crafting seamless user interfaces. With three years of experience in the field, I've worked my way up from junior roles to becoming a lead developer, honing my skills along the way at Prism.fm and through independent projects.

// I love collaborating on exciting projects, building beautiful, functional apps, and constantly finding ways to improve both the user experience and developer workflow. Whether it's bringing ideas to life with clean, intuitive code or optimizing processes to make life easier for everyone involved, I'm all in.

// Currently, I'm developing engaging web experiences at Taifa-Casino, a rising startup in Kenya's online betting scene. When I'm not doing that, you can find me working on my own creative projects under DenisWritesCode and Caesius Agency.

// Take a look at my portfolio to see some of my work. If you'd like to connect or have an interesting project in mind, don't hesitate to reach out.
